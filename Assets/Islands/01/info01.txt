That pirate scum, Warrick, is wanted in Port Reddar. Whoever finds him will get a sum total of 10 golds.

Beware of his fleet dogs.

Screw you with your 10 goldies

Foley, I told you many times that you should stop looking for Isla Prudera. 
It's just a waste of time. I asked around and only some crazy old sailors mentioned about it. Don't go after it.
And if Rogers tries to get to you with his stupid ambitions head it over to me I'll deal with it.

I left the proof of the existance of the Isle scattered on three different islands. 
You need to find it all and destroy as soon as possible. Warrick is now scouting with his dogs. 
He's going after my tail. I will disappear for some time. Do not look for me, better find the proof.

P.S. It's those isles I was telling you about in previous letter. 
And, yes, the one with a trapdoor in the center is Cross one.

DeadCorpseNote-
I tried remembering the pirate song I heard. 
It went like 'yo-ho, yo-ho no danger there's for me...'

Scrap that song, the bloody ghost can still hear me. I need to be cautious here. 
Someone used this land, there's a locked trapdoor somewhere in the center. 
Please, pilot, avoid me this night.
